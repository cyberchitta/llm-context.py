# Focused Context Creation

## What This Does
Creates a custom rule that includes ONLY specific files you choose - some with full content, others with just code structure outlines. All other repository files are ignored, giving you a targeted context with just what you need.

## How to Request It
```
Create focused rule:
- Name: [rule-name]
- Description: [brief description]  
- Full files: [files you need to see completely]
- Outline files: [files you only need structure from]
```

## Example
**Request:**
```
Create focused rule:
- Name: api-auth
- Description: API authentication
- Full files: /myproject/src/auth.py, /myproject/config/auth.yaml
- Outline files: /myproject/src/models/user.py
```

**Generated YAML to save as `.llm-context/rules/api-auth.md`:**
```yaml
---
name: "api-auth"
description: "API authentication"
compose:
  filters: ["lc-block-all"]
files:
  - "/myproject/src/auth.py"
  - "/myproject/config/auth.yaml"
outlines:
  - "/myproject/src/models/user.py"
---

Focused context for API authentication.
```
