## 📂 How to Request Missing Files 📂

If you need to see the contents of files that are not fully available (marked with "✗" or "○" in the repository structure below), please follow these steps:

1. Immediately halt your current response.
2. Start a new response with a markdown code block (```) on a new line.
3. List the root-relative paths of the missing files you need, one per line.
4. Close the markdown code block with another ```.
5. End your response.

Example file request:

```
{%- for file in sample_requested_files %}
{{ file }}
{%- endfor %}
```

The human will then provide the requested file contents in the next message.
